# CS-A-Z-Notes
A collection of my notes on everything I study about CS till Dec 2021 ðŸ§ 

Basically I've got a lot of free time and a bunch on incomplete courses I paid real cash for. Here is the free TLDR for everyone of them (notes/links/everything) that I am going to painstakingly type on my own ðŸ’» 

This repo will grow with time. Consider giving it a ðŸŒŸ and join me in this journey.
